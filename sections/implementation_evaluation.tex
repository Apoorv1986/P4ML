\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
\ap{1 Page for: Implementation + Evaluation + Discussion}

\subsection{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item software architecture
    \item software modules developed
    \item frameworks \& tools used
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation}
\ap{For now, include handmade plots that we expect and also figures so that we have an idea of how much space we are left with?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the metrics that should be evaluated?
    \item performance metrics: execution time, individual bug detection time?, how many bugs were detected?,
    \item metrics to evaluate the machine learning approach:
    \item cumulative reward over time (during training phase), to indicate the quality of the learning process
    \item ???
\end{itemize}
